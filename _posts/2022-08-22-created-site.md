Thank you for visiting my blog.

My research heavily involves developing innovative custom machine learning (ML) approaches to address a range of complex environmental challenges. I am a trained coastal geomorphologist/geologist with extensive experience in remote sensing, geogphysics, teaching, and field methods.

Because my research is at the nexus of so many fields and I am constantly trying to address new and exciting challenges, I thought it might be interesting and valuable to share some of what I learn, even if it's just the occasional URL and brief synopsis.

Check back for any updates and if you have any suggested topics please let me know.
